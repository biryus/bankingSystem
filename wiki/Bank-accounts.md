### Creating new accounts
If a user would like to create a new bank account, they can click the blue _Create new account_ button on the right side of the home page. They can then optionally specify a display name, which is only visible to them, to more easily distinguish between their different accounts.

### Account display name
To help users more easily distinguish their accounts, a display name is shown instead of the account number in various places throughout the UI. The display name can be set when creating an account, and can be changed at any time by clicking on the pen icon which appears when hovering over the account number on the details page, as well as on the home page.

After clicking on the pen icon, a dialog box appears, allowing the user to specify a new display name.
