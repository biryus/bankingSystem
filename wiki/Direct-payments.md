Direct payments are a way to securely pay on websites directly through a bank account without the need to provide card details.

> Note: Direct payments require the _CentralApi_ to be [[set up and running|Getting started#configuration]]

An example implementation of direct payments can be found in the included _DemoShop_ project.

### Making direct payments
When the user chooses to use this option, the merchant website generates and digitally signs a payment request containing the amount, a description of the payment, and the details of the destination bank account.

The user is then redirected to the _CentralApi_, where all supported banks are listed and the user has to select theirs.

After the user selects a bank, the _CentralApi_ includes the bank's private key in the payment request generated by the merchant, signs it, and redirects the user to their bank, where, after logging in, they can choose a source account and complete their payment.

The user is then redirected back to the merchant website, where the signatures of the payment are verified and the order is marked as completed.
