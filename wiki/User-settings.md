For security reasons, sessions are automatically terminated after 5 minutes of inactivity.

Additionally, accounts are locked out for several minutes if a wrong password has been entered too many times in a row.

## Two-factor authentication

Since two-factor authentication is very important for account security, users who have not activated two-factor authentication are shown a message after login.

To enable two-factor authentication, users can either do it on the _Account settings_ page or by clicking the _Enable now_ button on the above message after logging in.

BankSystem requires the use of Google Authenticator or a similar mobile application for generating two-factor authentication codes.
